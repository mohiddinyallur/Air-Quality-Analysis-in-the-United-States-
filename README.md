# Air-Quality-Analysis-in-the-United-States
This project analyzes U.S. air quality from 2000-2022, focusing on NO2, SO2, CO, and O3 levels. It identifies pollution trends, and regional variations, and correlates health impacts. The aim is to provide data-driven recommendations for improving air quality and informing targeted environmental and health policies.



**Business Problem Statement:** Comprehensive Analysis and Mitigation Strategy Development for Air Pollution in the United States

**Background:**  
Air pollution is a critical environmental and public health issue that has garnered increasing attention in recent years. The United States, with its diverse geography and industrial activities, experiences varying levels of air quality across different regions. Key pollutants such as Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Sulphur Dioxide (SO2), Carbon Monoxide (CO), and Ozone (O3) pose significant threats to both human health and the environment. With rising concerns over the long-term impacts of these pollutants, it is imperative to conduct a comprehensive analysis to understand their trends, spatial distribution, and potential health implications.

**Scope:**  
This project aims to analyze air quality data in the United States over a 22-year period, from 2000 to 2022. The focus is on key pollutants—NO2, SO2, CO, and O3—that are known to have adverse effects on respiratory health, contribute to environmental degradation, and exacerbate climate change. The dataset includes detailed records of pollutant concentrations across various regions, allowing for a granular examination of temporal and spatial patterns.

**Objective:**  
The primary objective is to identify trends and anomalies in air pollution levels, assess the effectiveness of existing environmental policies, and develop data-driven mitigation strategies. By understanding the regional variations in pollutant concentrations, policymakers can craft targeted interventions to improve air quality. Additionally, the analysis aims to correlate pollution levels with public health outcomes, thereby providing insights that can guide health advisories and public awareness campaigns.

**Expected Outcomes:**  
- Detailed trends and patterns in air pollution levels across the United States.
- Identification of regions with the highest levels of pollution and potential hotspots.
- Recommendations for policy adjustments and mitigation strategies to reduce pollution.
- Correlation of pollution data with health statistics to inform public health strategies.
